Give a Talk
===========

We are actively `looking for talks`_.
We welcome your talk even if you have no public speaking experience.
Our fifteen minute talks are long enough so that you don't have
the pressure of fitting all your material into a succient lightning talk --
but short enough to be easy to give.
