* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following

Additionally, Pyninsula welcomes its younger members.

Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour,
event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a
welcoming environment for all participants.
This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.

Meetup organisers may take action to redress anything designed to,
or with the clear impact of,
disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetup venues and
meetup-related social activities.
We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

Reporting
~~~~~~~~~

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome,
please report it as soon as possible.
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event
for everyone.
We want you to be happy at our event.
People like you make our event a better place.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

Personal Report

When taking a personal report,
we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard.
We may involve other organizers to ensure your report is managed properly.
Once safe,
we'll ask you to tell us about what happened.
This can be upsetting,
but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible,
and you can bring someone to support you.
At no point will you be asked to confront anyone and
at no point, unless you ask us to, will we tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact venue security,

or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event.
We value your attendance.
