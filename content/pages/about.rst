About Pyninsula
===============

We are a meetup group in the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula.
We meet once a month to talk about Python.
Our definition of the Peninsula is "the 650 area code".
We welcome participants from every corner of the earth,
but we choose hosts inside the 650 area.

We are actively `looking for talks`-.
